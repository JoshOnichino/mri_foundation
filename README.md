# Finetune SAM on your customized medical imaging dataset

This is the official code for our paper: [How to build the best medical image segmentation algorithm using foundation models: a comprehensive empirical study with Segment Anything Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09957), where we propose a new foundation model designed specifically for MRI.

The final weights can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nPkTI3H0vsujlzwY8jxjKwAbOCTJv4yW/view?usp=sharing).
